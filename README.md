# Data-Structures_&_Algorithm
----------------------

A data structure is a named location that can be used to store and organize data. And, an algorithm is a collection of steps to solve a particular problem. ... Our DSA tutorial will guide you to learn different types of data structures and algorithms and their implementations in Python, C, C++, and Java.

An algorithm must have five properties:
-------------------------------

* Input specified.
* Output specified.
* Definiteness.
* Effectiveness.
* Finiteness.


To write algorithm
---------
>Search − Algorithm to search an item in a data structure.

>Sort − Algorithm to sort items in a certain order.

>Insert − Algorithm to insert item in a data structure.

>Update − Algorithm to update an existing item in a data structure.

>Delete − Algorithm to delete an existing item from a data structure.
